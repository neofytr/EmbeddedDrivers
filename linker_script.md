### **Role of the Linker Script**

The linker script is a configuration file that tells the linker how to organize and place the various sections of an object file (`.o`) into the final executable file (e.g., `.elf`). It provides precise control over memory layout, symbol placement, and section alignment for the program.

In the context of embedded systems like ARM Cortex-M, the linker script plays a crucial role in:

1. **Memory Mapping**:
   - Defines the memory regions (e.g., Flash, RAM, peripherals).
   - Specifies where different sections (e.g., `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`) should be placed.

2. **Section Placement**:
   - Determines where sections of code and data from object files are placed in the memory map.
   - For example:
     - `.text` (program code) goes in Flash memory.
     - `.data` (initialized variables) is stored in Flash but copied to SRAM at runtime.
     - `.bss` (uninitialized variables) is reserved in SRAM and zeroed out at runtime.

3. **Initialization Code**:
   - Facilitates the generation of startup code to initialize the `.data` and `.bss` sections during the reset handler.

4. **Symbol Definition**:
   - Allows defining custom symbols (e.g., `_start`, `_stack_top`) used by the program.

5. **Control Over Alignment**:
   - Ensures proper alignment of sections and variables, which is critical for performance and correctness on certain architectures.

### **How the Linker Script Works**

The linker script is written in a domain-specific language and processed by the linker (e.g., GNU `ld`). Here’s a step-by-step explanation of its workflow:

---

#### **1. Memory Definition**

The `MEMORY` block defines the physical memory regions available on the target:

```ld
MEMORY
{
  FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 256K
  RAM (rwx)  : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 64K
}
```

- **Regions**:
  - `FLASH`: Non-volatile memory for storing code and constants.
  - `RAM`: Volatile memory for variables and stack.
- **Attributes**:
  - `r`: Readable.
  - `w`: Writable.
  - `x`: Executable.

---

#### **2. Section Placement**

The `SECTIONS` block specifies how sections are placed in memory. Each section (e.g., `.text`, `.data`) is mapped to a specific memory region.

```ld
SECTIONS
{
  .text : 
  {
    KEEP(*(.isr_vector))    /* Keep the interrupt vector table. */
    *(.text*)               /* All .text sections from object files. */
  } > FLASH                 /* Place in FLASH memory. */

  .data : 
  {
    _data_start = .;        /* Define start symbol for .data. */
    *(.data*)               /* All .data sections from object files. */
    _data_end = .;          /* Define end symbol for .data. */
  } > RAM AT > FLASH        /* Place in RAM, but load from FLASH. */

  .bss :
  {
    _bss_start = .;
    *(.bss*)
    *(COMMON)
    _bss_end = .;
  } > RAM                   /* Place in RAM. */
}
```

---

#### **3. Initialization**

For sections like `.data`, which must be loaded into RAM but stored in Flash, the linker script specifies:

- The runtime location (in RAM).
- The load location (in Flash).

```ld
.data : > RAM AT > FLASH
```

- `> RAM`: Indicates the runtime location in RAM.
- `AT > FLASH`: Indicates the load location in Flash.

During startup, a copy operation (performed by startup code) moves `.data` from Flash to RAM.

---

#### **4. Alignment and Padding**

The linker ensures proper alignment of sections using directives like `ALIGN`. For example:

```ld
. = ALIGN(4);
```

This guarantees that the current address is aligned to a 4-byte boundary.

---

#### **5. Defining Symbols**

Symbols can be defined to represent specific addresses or markers in memory:

```ld
_estack = ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM);  /* Define top of the stack. */
```

- These symbols can be used in the program (e.g., in assembly code or C startup files).

---

### **Example Workflow**

1. **Input**:
   - Object files (`.o` files) generated by the compiler.
   - Linker script defining memory layout and section mappings.

2. **Processing**:
   - The linker reads the linker script and maps the sections from the `.o` files into the defined memory regions.
   - Resolves all symbolic references and calculates absolute addresses for branches, data references, etc.

3. **Output**:
   - Generates the final `.elf` file with:
     - Fully resolved addresses.
     - Memory sections mapped as defined by the script.
     - Relocation and symbol references resolved.

### **Example Linker Script for ARM Cortex-M**

Here’s a minimal example for an STM32F401 (Cortex-M4):

```ld
MEMORY
{
  FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 512K
  RAM (rwx)  : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 128K
}

SECTIONS
{
  /* Code and read-only data */
  .text :
  {
    _text_start = .;
    KEEP(*(.isr_vector))    /* Interrupt vector table. */
    *(.text*)               /* Code sections. */
    *(.rodata*)             /* Read-only data. */
    _text_end = .;
  } > FLASH

  /* Initialized data */
  .data : 
  {
    _data_start = .;
    *(.data*)               /* Initialized variables. */
    _data_end = .;
  } > RAM AT > FLASH

  /* Uninitialized data */
  .bss :
  {
    _bss_start = .;
    *(.bss*)
    *(COMMON)
    _bss_end = .;
  } > RAM

  /* Stack */
  .stack :
  {
    _stack_start = .;
    . = ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM);    /* Allocate full RAM for stack. */
    _stack_end = .;
  } > RAM
}
```

### **Summary**

The linker script is the blueprint for transforming relocatable `.o` files into a final executable `.elf` file. It defines the memory layout, maps sections to specific regions, aligns data, and sets up initialization. For ARM Cortex-M, it ensures that the program fits within the microcontroller's Flash and RAM while aligning with hardware constraints and runtime requirements.
